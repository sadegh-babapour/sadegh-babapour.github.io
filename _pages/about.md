I'm a ```junior``` data scientist who excels at data wrangling, machine learning, exploratory analysis, and data visualizations.

I am also competent in Object Oriented Programming and my favorite Language for that is **```Java```**. I have worked on quite a few mini projects during my studies making OOP related as well as Design Patterns related programs.

I like exploratory data analysis and working on data using jupyter notebooks.I have also done a few Data Visulaization Dashboards with __```Tableau```__.

In my free time, I like to read classic novels and my favorite authors in no particular order are: ```Steinbeck```, ```Kundera```, ```Marquez``` and ```Dostoevesky```.
