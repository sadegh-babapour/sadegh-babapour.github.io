Discalimer: I do have a plugin from google analytics for this small blog thingy that's supposed to be professional?! to see if I have any audience or not! 3 users spent 3 minutes on the last article! not bad
</p>

<p>
Promise to self: I will try to keep track of the paragraphs as I dig deeper. Let's go!
</p>

Alright, the trip started at 7:30 AM mountain time. well not exactly, it was quite a challenging few days before Tuesday October the 27th. THursday had my final phone convo with a buddy of mine who resides in Montreal, nice guy overall with few interesting! points but who doesn't? that was the camel that broke the starw's back! I HAD in all honesty been thinking about leaving cowtown for quite a while but leaving the comfort known zone to explore the unknown has always been daunting!
</p>

<p> ended the phone call, thought about it for like efw hours while lying down and listening to pink floyd --> high hopes, shine on you crazy diamond and et al. went for another drive to make sure if it's really the best move, confession: Driving has always had some form of meditating effect on me, always. came back, looked at all the things and stuff, realized to roll the ball and make this plan happen, I need to farewell with quite a lot of stuff filling the place and the hesitation like should I keep this or nah? will I need this later or should I get rid of it like right now cause if I leave it for later on, I will have a big pile of later on stuff and not much room in the car for other Essential stuff!
</p>

<p>Finally came up with a plan to divide stuff into 3 categories: A: Stuff to take, B: Stuff to donate: [priority A & B ==> A for neighbours in the building and B for the donation centers and finally category C: Things that ended up in the dumpster: Quite a lot actually in retrospect! I had hoarded a lot of useless sh*t since I moved here.  It was EXHAUSTING and really challenging as to think on the spot of what to keep and what not, there was no ticket or airplane pressing on the agility of the matter, but I felt like if I don't do this now and fast, I will find a way to ruin the whole plan and stay till the end of the winter</p>

<p>Flash forward: *opens the window to let the cool air of montreal breathe in and sips from the hot chocolate cup! Feels good man! a big grin on the face, if you think only Nolan Bors can do this flash forward and backward, hold my beer bro! 
</p>

<p>actual flash -> I am here in Montreal, loooking for jobs during the day and planning visits to different few open historical places, not many places open but Je Travai. Side note: Not many jobs here are Bilingual or Just English, something I knew, but you narrow your options when ** Je ne pas parle francais mon ami**.
I must say I love this place! Why? we'll come back! creating suspense!!
</p>

<p>flash <== packed stuff, did the horrible moving out cleaning, got rid of some the extra stuff last minute, in Iran and Football (Soccer) watching countries there's this 90th mintue actions, anyway, jumped into the car, it was freezing as F! stopped at the gas station, Tank Full, ready set go, destination Regina, rhymes like Va**na!! Seriouly pick a BETTER NAME!! 
</p>
<p>As I drove through 16 street with the usual downtown commuters traffic, although I was feeling nostalgic for whatever reason, it wasn't my homeland or anything to be honest, that feeling was gone and a new energy was rising up in me. with a cup of Large 1 cream 1 sugar Timmies,Canadian, in a German Car, listening to some french music to get my self in the zone, I was reaching towards medicine hat, the last city in AB and soon moving towards Saskachewan the flatlands, boring straight roads with not many people on the road.</p>

<p> Time to commit and see how this looks like so far</p>
