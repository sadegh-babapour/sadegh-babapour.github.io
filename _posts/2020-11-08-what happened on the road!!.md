Discalimer: I do have a plugin from google analytics for this small blog thingy that's supposed to be professional?! to see if I have any audience or not! 3 users spent 3 minutes on the last article! not bad
</p>

<p>
Promise to self: I will try to keep track of the paragraphs as I dig deeper. Let's go!
</p>

<p>
Alright, the trip started at 7:30 AM mountain time. well not exactly, it was quite a challenging few days before Tuesday October the 27th. THursday had my final phone convo with a buddy of mine who resides in Montreal, nice guy overall with few interesting! points but who doesn't? that was the camel that broke the starw's back! I HAD in all honesty been thinking about leaving cowtown for quite a while but leaving the comfort known zone to explore the unknown has always been daunting!
</p>

<p> ended the phone call, thought about it for like efw hours while lying down and listening to pink floyd --> high hopes, shine on you crazy diamond and et al. went for another drive to make sure if it's really the best move, confession: Driving has always had some form of meditating effect on me, always. came back, looked at all the things and stuff, realized to roll the ball and make this plan happen, I need to farewell with quite a lot of stuff filling the place and the hesitation like should I keep this or nah? will I need this later or should I get rid of it like right now cause if I leave it for later on, I will have a big pile of later on stuff and not much room in the car for other Essential stuff!
</p>

<p>Finally came up with a plan to divide stuff into 3 categories: A: Stuff to take, B: Stuff to donate: [priority A & B ==> A for neighbours in the building and B for the donation centers and finally category C: Things that ended up in the dumpster: Quite a lot actually in retrospect! I had hoarded a lot of useless sh*t since I moved here.  It was EXHAUSTING and really challenging as to think on the spot of what to keep and what not, there was no ticket or airplane pressing on the agility of the matter, but I felt like if I don't do this now and fast, I will find a way to ruin the whole plan and stay till the end of the winter</p>

<p>Flash forward: *opens the window to let the cool air of montreal breathe in and sips from the hot chocolate cup! Feels good man! a big grin on the face, if you think only Nolan Bors can do this flash forward and backward, hold my beer bro! 
</p>

<p>actual flash -> I am here in Montreal, loooking for jobs during the day and planning visits to different few open historical places, not many places open but Je Travai. Side note: Not many jobs here are Bilingual or Just English, something I knew, but you narrow your options when ** Je ne pas parle francais mon ami**.
I must say I love this place! Why? we'll come back! creating suspense!!
</p>

<p>flash <== packed stuff, did the horrible moving out cleaning, got rid of some the extra stuff last minute, in Iran and Football (Soccer) watching countries there's this 90th mintue actions, anyway, jumped into the car, it was freezing as F! stopped at the gas station, Tank Full, ready set go, destination Regina, rhymes like Va**na!! Seriouly pick a BETTER NAME!! 
</p>
<p>As I drove through 16 street with the usual downtown commuters traffic, although I was feeling nostalgic for whatever reason, it wasn't my homeland or anything to be honest, that feeling was gone and a new energy was rising up in me. with a cup of Large 1 cream 1 sugar Timmies,Canadian, in a German Car, listening to some french music to get my self in the zone, I was reaching towards medicine hat, the last city in AB and soon moving towards Saskachewan the flatlands, boring straight roads with not many people on the road.</p>

<p> Time to commit and see how this looks like so far... looks good movin' on</p>

<p>
##SK : That ol' boring corner store series sums up this place better than I expected</p>
<p></p>

<p>Arrived at the "Hotel" that I had reserved nothing fancy two! queen beds for one ;) lol. got some rest although the 7 hour drive really hadn't tire me a bit, but it was the first day and was testing the water for the next long day. got up, felt hungry, went to a grocery store and got al the stuff for a cold sandwich something quick and pack of water bottles, came back to the hotel ate up, now feeling bored, hmm, what to do, tried the casino, not many people in sight and the front desk staff didn't even put on a show for the covid related stuff, while keeping her head down, asked the usual have you been sick, have you been out of the country, .... like yeah, I came back from an overseas trip and the first thing to do is come to a place to lose all my canadian plastic money. that's it, although I drove around the city to see what it looks like, in all honest nothing to see here folks, except that it is the polic state? or the state where you will see an unnecessary number of cameras, traffic camers to be exact, all over the place, and by the looks of it, a lot of really poor people there too. te gist: Too many cameras and too many police cars, I had heard that they sent new police hires there to be trained but that many cameras? waste of tax payers money in my not-so-humble opinion!, next is the military state, Manitoba!</p>


<p>flash ==> Montreal: The city with a Parking Problem ==> Please put some English besides the french uhmm quebecois signs as well, at least for the street signs!
</p>

<p>best places so far besides indeed montreal and linked montreal jobs are Old Montreal and the little Italy; I actually ended up in a spanish church?! or was it the latin speaking folk mass time? anyways, lack of command of local language could be a blessing in disguise too sometimes. nothing new about the old montral that you cant find online, except you need to come here and see it yourself. Oh, getting back to why I love Montreal! lol. well...</p>

<p>Obviously Montreal has hotter and better looking female persons!! I mean really, yea compared to calgary it has more people and statistics and blah blah blah, but the statement is still true, montreal has a lot more, and a lot better looking chicks! jokes aside, I have always been fascinated with historical stuff and there are a lot of awe inspiring places here, if I amo not mistaken, Montreal is an island, so those tall buildings with real human size statues made with iron or stone, who made them? did they get the material here or were they shipped here bu the french? anyways, if you like historical stuff and like artistic attactions, compared to that Big Blue Ring near Stoney trail? or the mesh face in front of bow tower, This Place kicks some serious A-S-S. truth be told, you need to go out of calgary to see some good stuff, Dinosaur stuff in Drumheller comes to mind.</p>


<p>Manitoba: Really Good Burger place, oh and I saw a military trasport car followed by a "Disguised" truck on the road : Manitoba ==> I just passed through the province, only for a quick stop at one of thier famous burger joints and it was actually a nice tasty burger with some fries and milkshake, I guess Canada's military stuff is here since for some reason I saw a vehicle with green paint and etc... going to some unknown location: it was a scene for some one on the road, nothing fancy</p>

<p>flash ==> I hate big cities, but I think I'll make an exception here. all big cities get away with the BS they pull on their residents, like parking, housing prices, really non-sensible traffic laws or road closures to milk the average folk, plus, I will miss the "Only GST" in Alberta, plus, outraging taxes and really terrible road conditions, but the + parts are far heavier to leace this place, plus I really want to make it here in software stuff and tis the place!, Toronto is the SH**T, but that's too big of a city for me and everything is overpriced except your salary, plus for now, most likely I would have ended up in some near city like brampton or something, don't know, will see how things go, My plan is either finance or game companies, first one for the money and 2nd one for the experience! plus it's fun making games rather than making software for some oil company, which they will pay a lot more for the user of the software, mostt likely the person will be an attractive female, yeah, that's right, One of the reasons the oilesp in AB is suffering becsause the "Managers" wanted to balance the work force! Yeah Right, anyways just not sound like a massageonistic!!! lol, pig, I did go on a date with someone whom had a bio-soething degree working in a drilling company! SO YEAH!, anyways I am glad that I can do some coding and choose to live in some other places other than oil producing places which are limited!<p>

<p>Part II will come later, More to come later! and As Always just like Vsauce Michael here, thnx for reading!! :) Au revoir</p>
