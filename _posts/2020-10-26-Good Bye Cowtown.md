#### Emotions and feelings happen man!...Shit it just happened to me!

Going through dificult times, you learn to appreciate the simple things in life. like for example, even if you are foreign funny looking guy who is reaslly dope and awesome, ended up living in a poor neighborhood in Calgary: The Cowtown, and life is not exactly going as you planned, you still get to cherish the small talk moments which turn into weekend evening long dialogues.

I have recently discovered the reason for my mind through Gigabits of data in a very short time to make sure no exaggeration is happening here, is my Attention Deficit Hyperactive Disorder. Sure it's great when you're being creative and trying to see things from multiple different angle, but even when you're 100 oercent sure of what you want to do, or need to do, you just keep pushing it aside. It's not coming from laziness, it's the lack of sense of time, which means you know you need to do this, but you don't feel like that it's something due in near future. Like if you want to take your car to the carwash 1 month from today, like yea, it's still in ok shape, i'll take it after a month or more realistically I'll do it next week.
